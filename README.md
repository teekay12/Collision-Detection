# Collision-Detection

This is a simple app that detects intersections from multiple objects and returns the intersected objects with graphical representations.

I have used Javascript and HTML for this solution and used a concept called a bounding box, which one of its uses is for collision detection.

Improvement to this will be to add support to 3D objects
